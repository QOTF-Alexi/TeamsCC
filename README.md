# TeamsCC
I made this script because I found a rather annoying bug in Microsoft Teams. When you hover over a person their profile picture, a different profile picture would appear.
This is caused by Microsoft not being capable of adding a button for the end user to clear cache, or even, to automate it daily.

## What it does
This script can be run if Microsoft Teams is open or closed. Firstly, it will kill all the Microsoft Teams related processes, then proceed to delete every cache folder that exists in the Microsoft Teams installation folder.
You won't just win disk space, but you will also be able to see the new profile pictures of users!

## How to use it
All you have to do is double-click the batch file.
You can also use this as a launcher kind of program, as it cleans all the cache and then (re)opens the program.

## What you need to use it
- A Windows computer
- Microsoft Teams

## Extra information
If you want to share this script, please do not post the script directly. Link people to this page instead!
Teams can be slow to load up as it needs to recreate some files again.
